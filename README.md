# AIStory
An infinite interactive text adventure game powered by LLMs.
## 📖 What is AIStory?

**AIStory** is not just a chatbot; it's a **Goal-Oriented Text RPG platform**. 

Instead of aimless chatting, we provide a library of curated **Scenarios (Scripts)**—each with a unique background, role, and ultimate objective. The AI acts as a dynamic Game Master, generating random plot twists and events within these frameworks. Your goal is to survive, solve the mystery, or achieve the script's ending.

### 🎮 Gameplay Loop

1.  **Select a Scenario :** * Choose from dozens of preset scripts like *"Survive a Zombie Apocalypse"*, *"Court the Cold Duchess"*, or *"Escape the Locked Room"*.
2.  **Face Random Events:**
    * The AI generates unique situations and obstacles in real-time. Even if you play the same script twice, the events will be different.
3.  **Your Choice & Custom Actions:**
    * Pick from AI-suggested options OR **type literally anything** you want to do. The AI will judge the outcome of your creativity.
4.  **Achieve the Goal:**
    * Every script has a win condition (e.g., "Live for 7 days", "Find the killer"). Once achieved, the game concludes with a unique ending report.

## 🌟 Why Play AIStory?

* **🎯 Goal-Driven:** Unlike endless AI chats, our games have a clear purpose and endings.
* **🎲 Roguelike Experience:** The main plot is set, but the encounters are randomized. A simple trip to the market might trigger a random assassination attempt or a lucky find.
* **🧠 Total Freedom:** You aren't limited to "A/B/C" choices. Want to try to bribe the dragon instead of fighting it? Type it in and see what happens.
